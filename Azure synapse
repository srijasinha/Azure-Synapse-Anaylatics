Azure Synapse Anlaytics will bring both Azure Datawarehouse and Big Data Warehousing together.
It is a single service ,combination of ADF, ADLS(Azure data lake storage),ADB - Azure DataBicks, SQL DB  AND File system in ADLS Gen2
Fundamentals Topics:
1)Azure  Synapse Workspace: we can perform data warehouse activity,ETL operations,all cloud based activity, data engineering., Data Transformation Logics.
It contains  File system and ADLS Gen2. We can run SQL quruies directly of run Notebooks directly throgh SQL pool.

2)Linked Service: Its a connection string that connect the workspace with external resources.

3)Synapse SQL -It is abality to do T- SQL based anaylitics in synapse workspace.Synapse SQL pool helps to run sql scripts.
Sql Pools has two types of consumption  models- 
1)serverless - It uses to run sql queries automitically /(Built in feature).Workspace will use for the physical resources for a time only when we run the query.
2)Dedicated- We are keeping the physical resources always available even we are not running the query.We can crete a new Dedicated SQL Pool. 

4)Apache synapse for sparks:- We can run spark jobs.We can create apache spark pools in a workspace.
Two ways to use spark in synapse- 
1)Spark Notebook-For using data science and data enginner using scale, spark SQL,c#
2)Spark Job Notification-For running batch spark jobs using jar files.

5)Pipelines- Pipeline are logical group of activities that perform task together. 
a)Trigger
b)Dataset
c)Data Flows

Praactical:-
We need to create new Azure Synapse Anlaytics workspace.It will ask Data Lake storage Gen2
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) - is a cloud-based data storage service built on Azure Blob Storage, designed for big data analytics.
We use Azure synapse studio

1)How to anylase data in serverless SQL pool in Azure synapse Anlytics
Ans- Let you use SQL without having to reserve capacity.
